{"name":"Vegalive","tagline":"live preview of Vega visualizations","body":"[Vega][] is a declarative language for making data visualizations. It's bona fide awesome. Check it out.\r\n\r\n[Vega]: http://trifacta.github.io/vega/\r\n\r\nThis is a tiny tool for quickly viewing Vega visualizations, complete with live updates. You can live-code your visualization in your favorite editor. Or you can automatically see updates as new points are added to a data file---so you can watch an experiment progress in real time.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QuCHRU5q4tU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nVegalive is written for [Node.js][], so it's installed with [npm][]. Just type:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install -g vegalive\r\n\r\n[npm]: https://npmjs.org/\r\n[Node.js]: http://nodejs.org/\r\n\r\nThen, go to a directory that has one of your Vega specs (i.e., .json files) and type:\r\n\r\n    $ vegalive\r\n\r\nAs the output suggests, you'll then want to point your browser at [http://localhost:4915](http://localhost:4915). There you'll see a list of JSON documents in the current directory. Click on your plot's filename to see it rendered in glorious HTML5.\r\n\r\nThen the magic happens:\r\n\r\n* Edit the spec in your favorite editor. Whenever you save, the plot refreshes in your browser.\r\n\r\n* Edit the data files that your visualization uses (or have another tool update them). The plot refreshes automatically.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
